# We want to avoid unnecessary test runs, because they load the API, so:
# - we run tests for all changes in PRs
# - we run deploys for all version-tagged commits
# - we don't want to do anything for any other cases
# Travis has a bunch of filtering that's supposed to cover this sort of thing, but
# it doesn't quite work.
