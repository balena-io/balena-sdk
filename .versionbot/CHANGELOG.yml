        Node 14 may well still work with the SDK for
        quite a while, but we'll no longer actively test
        against them since they are now
        characterized as EOL, and it's quite possible
        that it may stop working entirely in any future
        release.

                Be more lenient with decoding compressed responses, since (very
                rarely)

                servers send slightly invalid gzip responses that are still
                accepted

                by common browsers.


                Always using Z_SYNC_FLUSH is what cURL does.

                Otherwise request from the browser could end up
                on the domain of the current url. For the dashboard
                this would mean the UI nginx would respond with
                the page not found page, and that content would
                have ended up being saved as the token.

        that it may stop working entirely in any future
        release.

        The Radxa boards use different flashing mechanisms
        depending on the device model. Let's add a common
        step for them, which is entering maskrom mode. The
        actual procedure for entering this mode is detailed
        in the contract partials for each device.

        quite possible that it may stop working entirely in any
        future release.

                Be more lenient with decoding compressed responses, since (very
                rarely)

                servers send slightly invalid gzip responses that are still
                accepted

                by common browsers.


                Always using Z_SYNC_FLUSH is what cURL does.

        Setting a 3-digit semver to the release.semver field
        is the suggested approach, instead of setting the
        release.release_version field. This fixes the unique
        constraint issue that release_version was often
        causing to users, since in case a duplicate semver is
        provided, the backend will auto-increment the
        revision field of the release. A composite
        release.version field is also added, which has a raw
        field with the complete unique version of the release.

    - subject: Prevent invalid $selects in strict pine.get variant calls
      hash: 08dde2331405f29c8789bb2523a8e7fc574ba373
      body: |
        Used the NoInfer helper to prevent TS from using the
        old pine.get overloads, unless the generic
        parameters are explicitely provided. This way when
        no generic arguments are provided TS will try to
        match only the fully typed variants and in case of an
        error it will output the reason from those overloads.
        Previously it would fallback to the old pine.get
        variants and try to infer a loose generic type, which
        wasn't correct and silenced some errors This is a bit
        aggressive change and as a result I decided to limit
        this change for the strict pine variant, which is opt-in,
        and hold it back from the main typings until the next
        major.

        This is still in beta as not all deployment environments of
        balena easily support hostapps. Once we have resolved that issue
        we can move to hostapps-only model for serving OS releases.

      hash: f83e4f4d358b1a6eb9e7815a28014e56ad55f562
      body: |
        Dtslint's $ExpectType on TS 3.9.6 stopped expanding
        PineExpandableProps<Release> to the exact
        properties, which broke the tests. Stopped using
        $ExpectType in favor of using ts-toolbelt's Equals
        on a plain assignment. This also makes it easier to
        completely drop dtslint in a future PR, in favor of
        plain tsc using @ts-expect-error.

        This allows us to avoid loading:
        * lodash/throttle
        * memoizee
        * moment
        * balena-hup-action-utils

        in all files that import from the util.ts
        and also adds lazy loading when possible.

      hash: a30a648568ab788b8bacdec9951771cb054cccf3
      body: |
        Having autorebase enabled could lead to having
        more then one instances of the sdk tests running in
        parallel, which will result all of them failing, b/c they
        will use the same test user, and will also add
        unnecessary load to the API. Once we get #582 fixed
        we can remove this.

    - subject: Allow retrieving applications by application case insensitive slug
      hash: d3d97a37409af2186a02f39a7c63c75258693dec
      body: |
        This allows users to disambiguate shared
        applications that have the same name in a more
        user friendly way than using the application id.
        The application slug equals
        `${owner}/${app_name}`.toLowerCase() on the
        cloud api and it's just app_name.toLowerCase() in
        open balena, so we can be sure that the $or will
        never return more than one items when a slug is
        provided.

        At some point we changed the name field of RPI1 and
        had to update these tests to use the new one. We
        also recently reverted some OS releases, which as a
        result bought back the old name and broke the tests
        again. So, I decided to just use RPi2 for this tests

        This removed the commit field from the results of

        application.getAllWithDeviceServiceDetails(), which
        allows to drop the release $expand, in order to make
        those requests lighter for the API.
        We still keep the abstract object creation logic
        though, so that consumers depending on that field
        can just add the removed $expand on their provided
        pine options argument.

        Fixes #462
        Report ResinNotLoggedIn only when error 401 (unauthorised) is received
        or when user token is null or undefined (that either means user is
        already logged out or causes logging out with the next request). Every
        other case rethrow the original error to report the problem better.

        Define Karma preprocessor order explicitly
        Before this, the tests ran on Linux, but not OSX/Windows (because the
        `env` preprocessor order isn't define, and it was valid to run it
        before Browserify, which apparently doesn't work).

        One bug solved en route here, highlighted by minification: we depended
        on the

        function name of errors thrown by Resin-Request, which isn't dependable

        (e.g. in prescence of minification). We now depend on .code instead,

        which should work reliably.

        If the user passes a shorter uuid, and then we use this shorter uuid as
        a pine filter, it will match nothing, causing no errors but no real
        action, which can be very hard to debug.
        As a fix, we call `resin.models.device.get()` with the shorter uuid, and
        access the resulting `.uuid` field, which is ensured to be the full one,
        before passing it to pine.

    - author: Juan Cruz Viotti
      body: |-
        If a user passed a shorted uuid to `resin.models.device.move()`, the
        operation would fail without an error message (the device would still be
        on the older app) since the uuid was not being expanded into a full
        uuid before being used in the `pine`, which only understands full uuids.
