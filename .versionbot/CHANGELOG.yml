        I've tracked this back to the original commit that the
        typings for these methods were added and I can only

        This removed the commit field from the results of
        application.getWithDeviceServiceDetails() &
        application.getAllWithDeviceServiceDetails(), which
        allows to drop the release $expand, in order to make
        those requests lighter for the API.
        We still keep the abstract object creation logic
        though, so that consumers depending on that field
        can just add the removed $expand on their provided
        pine options argument.

        Fixes #462
        Report ResinNotLoggedIn only when error 401 (unauthorised) is received
        or when user token is null or undefined (that either means user is
        already logged out or causes logging out with the next request). Every
        other case rethrow the original error to report the problem better.

        Define Karma preprocessor order explicitly
        Before this, the tests ran on Linux, but not OSX/Windows (because the
        `env` preprocessor order isn't define, and it was valid to run it
        before Browserify, which apparently doesn't work).

        One bug solved en route here, highlighted by minification: we depended
        on the

        function name of errors thrown by Resin-Request, which isn't dependable

        (e.g. in prescence of minification). We now depend on .code instead,

        which should work reliably.

        If the user passes a shorter uuid, and then we use this shorter uuid as
        a pine filter, it will match nothing, causing no errors but no real
        action, which can be very hard to debug.
        As a fix, we call `resin.models.device.get()` with the shorter uuid, and
        access the resulting `.uuid` field, which is ensured to be the full one,
        before passing it to pine.

    - author: Juan Cruz Viotti
      body: |-
        If a user passed a shorted uuid to `resin.models.device.move()`, the
        operation would fail without an error message (the device would still be
        on the older app) since the uuid was not being expanded into a full
        uuid before being used in the `pine`, which only understands full uuids.
